## About This Project

This portfolio showcases my approach to frontend architecture, motion design, and scalable component systems.

Instead of decorative animations, I implemented a structured motion system that:

- Supports visual hierarchy
- Guides user attention intentionally
- Maintains performance
- Ensures accessibility and responsiveness
